My name is Eric Drewitz and I am both a Meteorologist (SUNY Oswego Class of 2016) and a self-taught software developer (started teaching myself software engineering in 2022-2023). 

My work focuses on developing new Python libraries focusing on weather and climate. 

Current libraries I've developed and actively maintain are:

1) [**FireWxPy**](https://pypi.org/project/firewxpy/) - An open source library focused on fire weather analysis and forecasting.

2) [**xmACIS2Py**](https://pypi.org/project/xmacis2py/) - An open source library focused on creating data visualizations of ACIS2 climate data (xmACIS2 in Python).

3) [**PyClimo**](https://pypi.org/project/pyclimo/) - An open source library for climate data analysis such as NCAR Reanalysis and PRISM data.

I hope to continue learning Python, specifically more about AI/ML/DL. In addition to Python, I hope to learn R and possibly C++, JavaScript/HTML/CSS. 

I hope you find my libraries useful whether you are an operational meteorologist, researcher, academic etc. My goal is to make computer programming for fellow meteorologists, atmospheric scientists and climate scientists alike.

***My name is Eric J. Drewitz and I am both a Meteorologist (SUNY Oswego Class of 2016) and a self-taught software developer with a focus on data-flow, data-science and data-engineering. I mainly code in the Python Programming Language.*** 

My work focuses on developing new Python libraries focusing on weather and climate. 

Current libraries I've developed and actively maintain are:

1) [**FireWxPy**](https://pypi.org/project/firewxpy/) - An open source library focused on fire weather analysis and forecasting.

2) [**xmACIS2Py**](https://pypi.org/project/xmacis2py/) - An open source library focused on creating data visualizations of ACIS2 climate data (xmACIS2 in Python).

3) [**PyClimo**](https://pypi.org/project/pyclimo/) - An open source library for climate data analysis such as NCAR Reanalysis and PRISM data.

4) [**WxData**](https://github.com/edrewitz/wxdata/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#wxdata) - An open source library that downloads, pre-processes and post-processes a medley of open-source weather data.

The WxData package provides the following extra functionality compared to existing packages for downloading weather data:

1) Friendly for users working on VPN/PROXY connections.

2) Converts GRIB variable keys into variable keys that are in plain language.

3) Has a scanner that checks if the data files on your PC are up to date with those on the data server. This helps newer developers avoid temporary IP address bans from data servers by avoiding excessive/repetative data downloading.

4) Preserves system memory by clearing out old data files with each new data download combined with the option for users to clear out their computer's recycle/trash bin with each run. 



***I hope you find my libraries useful whether you are an operational meteorologist, researcher, academic etc. My goal is to make computer programming easier for fellow meteorologists, atmospheric scientists and climate scientists alike.***
